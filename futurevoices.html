							<p class="tx_mebook">After extensive research, we became interested in urban projection as a way to invite community involvement into the process of imagining futures for their own spaces. To test this idea, we hosted a live urban projection experiment during the First Fridays festival in Garfield, a monthly event that brings art, music, and other events to vacant spaces along one of the neighborhood’s main avenues, Penn Avenue.</p>

							<p class="tx_mebook">Our learning from this experiment pushed us to ask ourselves: “how can we make this experience more accessible and scalable? And, for who?” Based on our research, interviews, and the incredible response of Future Friday’s youngest participants, we identified a need and opportunity to bring this to children as an applied curriculum.  This prompted us to consider the design of a Future Voices Toolkit, which we will develop and pilot with a partner organization as an independent study next semester.</p>

In addition, we structured the physical space to facilitate rich human interaction. 
<br>•&nbsp; The public was invited off the street by the visible projection, the enticing prompt to “draw their vision for the future of the space,” and our team members positioned at the street;
<br>•&nbsp; Participants would approach the drawing tablet where they would draw their future for the vacant lot;

<br>Started with a prompt  "Draw your vision for the future of the space," Futurefridays is a participatory projection mapping event that gathers crowd-sourced visions for the future of vacant spaces and projects those visions onto the space in real time. 
<br>The event succeeded both at engaging the community in active generation of the future of the vacant Garfield lot as well as triggering conversation between people, some strangers before the event, about the neighborhood as well as their visions for the future. </p>

							<p class="tx_mebook">Based off the learnings from Futurefridays - that children are natural futures, that futuring skills need to be nurtured, and that urban projection seems to be a promising tool for this activity - we conceived of Future Voices. Future Voices is an a open source toolkit for educators designed to equip children with critical and creative problem solving skills. Rather than an abstract set of methodologies, a conversation with Kristin Hughes a CMU professor and long-time community activist, prompted us to consider our role in designing the future of learning. What does education look like when we don’t know the challenges we’ll face or the tools we’ll need to address them? This is the basis from which we’ve imagined Future Voices.
</p><p class="tx_mebook" style="text-align:left;">The content of our toolkit will likely evolve as we engage in a co-design process with our partner, John Wallace, but as of now, we’ve imagined the Toolkit will have three main components <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; • &nbsp;&nbsp;	a hands-on curriculum using community issues and spaces as context for design projects
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; • &nbsp;&nbsp;	tools to support these hands on workshops
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; • &nbsp;&nbsp;	a guide to support educators in finding resources and engaging the community in issues central to the Future Voices curriculum - vacancy, de-centralized community city-making.</p>

							<p class="tx_mebook">The Future Voices curriculum will walk children through design projects grounded in familiar problems and spaces. It will be divided into three modules, focusing on three design skills. The structure of the curriculum loosely correlates to phases in the design process. Each workshop will be associated with the construction of a tool, which will support the workshops main activity. We will pilot each of the three modules over the semester. The three modules we propose are:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; • &nbsp;&nbsp;	Future — transform those opportunities into possible futures and bring them to life in physical space
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; • &nbsp;&nbsp;	Reflect— reflect on the impact of those futures and imagine possible consequences (both positive and negative) they might bring</p>

							<p class="tx_mebook">For our pilot, we have partnered with the Makers Clubhouse in the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh. We will be able to use a Bible Center Church and relevant context as material for our futuring workshop. Through various prompts and the construction of a small handhold projector, we’ll encourage children to identify opportunities to intervene in this space, imagine alternate futures and then project those futures onto the building’s surface. <br>
Because of our current work with projection as a collective futuring tool, we plan to launch our curricular pilot with the future module, taking on vacancy in Homewood as a focus. This curriculum will build upon our existing research and experimentation with projection, bringing this technology down to an appropriate scale for use in a classroom. We have been prototyping different construction tools and open-source instruction guides to find the most appropriate projector for our workshop. It is our hope that by working with projection as a medium, we can make abstract futures more concrete and facilitate dialogue and imagination around the potential futures for unused or underutilized spaces (i.e. vacant lots, buildings, businesses etc.).</p>
