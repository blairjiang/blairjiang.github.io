Considering the huge quantity of widgets, icons, and pages of the APP, the project management had to be efficient and effective.</div>

		<div class="desc tx_14 tx_cg">We investigated a certain number of active users of the APP, who were representative in many aspects, such as their ages, jobs, locations, frequency of use,etc. Meanwhile, we interviewed several experts of visual design in the industry, and collected and summarized their feedbacks. These information laid a solid foundation for our further discussion and brainstorm. Consequently, we drew a conclusion of the following keywords.</div>

		<div class="desc tx_14 tx_cg">Since the APP had already been run for around a year, the main users were familiar with the dominant tone, which meant the new characteristics should be added based on the existing dominant color.  In this stage, while nearly half of the team members were focusing on the daily operations of the former edition, several experienced designers in the team began to try brand new ideas and styles according to the key words.</div>

		<h2 class="tit tx_c tx_24 tx_cg">Homepage</h2>
		<div class="desc tx_14 tx_cg">Homepage is the most complicated and consequent page in the whole APP. It includes two kinds of feeds—original ones and reposted ones. Moreover, every single feed contains 4 parts of information— details of the publisher, the video, information of the video, and operations related to the feed. In order to illustrate the hierarchical relationship between all the different areas of information, as well as keep the whole design alacrity and concise, the visual design should be straightforward and clear. Finally we solved the problem by elaborately selecting and using several main colors to divide areas and keep them harmonious, qualifying the using of lines, considering white space as a vital element, reducing the using of texture, etc. Thus, although there is a great amount of information has to be showed on this page, the visual design keeps it simple and explicit.</div>
