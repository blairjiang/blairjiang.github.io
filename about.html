							<h1 class="tit">Hello,</h1>

							<p class="tx_cg tx_14 c_tw mt15">I am a designer who enjoys learning new things. I always seek for challenges to overcome that could make me a better designer. As a graduate from probably the best university in China — Peking University, and a senior designer with more than 6 years’ work experience in the best internet company of the nation–Tencent, my dream is to introduce the Western scientific methodology into the current design system in China which is more or less based on designers’ intuition and experience, in order to not only arouse concerns over the nature of design about the interaction between products and users, but also amplify the voice of user experience design in China’s internet industry. </p>

							<h3 class="tx_b tx_cg tx_18 c_tw mt25">Education Experience</h3>

							<p class="tx_cg tx_14 c_tw mt15">Born and grew up in Beijing, the capital of China and a city with a culture combining the traditional and the modern. Passionate about creative art and fascinated with design, I majored in Industry Design as an undergraduate. Four years later, on the strength of my outstanding performance in the highly competitive national examination, I entered the Department of Digital Art at Peking University, doing my postgraduate degree. I ranked in most courses among the top 10 (the average number of students in a class was around 80), and in some among the top 5; meanwhile, I was the minister of publicity for the Student Union of the School. </p>

							<p class="tx_cg tx_14 c_tw mt15">With this diversified education background, I acquired the fundamental techniques of design, such as color composition, plane formation, three-dimensional construction, sketch and drawing skills, etc; as well as a comprehensive and mature perspective of design.</p>

							<h3 class="tx_b tx_cg tx_18 c_tw mt25">Work Experience</h3>

							<p class="tx_cg tx_14 c_tw mt15">After obtaining the Master degree in 2009, I became an employee of Tencent. In this company, I got the chance to design products for vast amount of users, more importantly, I was at the forefront of the rapidly developing internet industry in China, and working with outstanding user experience designers, therefore my professional ability was improved constantly and evidently. </p>

							<p class="tx_cg tx_14 c_tw mt15">After one and a half years, I was appointed the head of the branding team of SOSO search engine and the mentor of interns. After another one and a half years, I was promoted to a senior designer and the leader of visual team. Consequently, I assumed the position of design leader and chief visual designer for programs one after another. During the 6 years in Tencent, I have experienced the rising of China’s Internet Age, learned the design of internet products in various fields, including the design of software on personal computers, traditional websites, the mobile webpage, the applications on iOS and Android platforms, and even print ads.
							</p>

							<h3 class="tx_b tx_cg tx_18 c_tw mt25">Hobbies</h3>

							<p class="tx_cg tx_14 c_tw mt15">When I’m not working, I like to practice kendo, and go to dance studio to learn New Jazz (Popular and Hip Hop) Dancing from professional dance teachers. On weekends, I do hiking with friends and families in the suburbs. Several years ago, I passed the examination of scuba diving and got the advanced open-water license, since then diving has become one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
